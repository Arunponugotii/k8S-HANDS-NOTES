Side-Car:
Web server is busy with getting requests from user,so side car gonna
 communicate with ELK and whatever the logs,metrics 
 genarated by Actual container will will send them to ELK

In pod all the container goona shares same network space and shared volumes.

In Kubernetes (k8s), a sidecar is a container that runs in 
the same pod as the main container and supports it by providing additional functionality. 
Sidecar containers can help with tasks such as logging, monitoring, security, and networking.

For example, a sidecar container could be
 used to monitor the logs of the main container and forward them
  to a centralized logging system. Another use case could be to provide encryption 
  and decryption services for network traffic going in and out of the main container.

The sidecar container is able to share the same network and file 
system as the main container, making it easier to provide these additional
 functionalities without having to modify the main container itself.
